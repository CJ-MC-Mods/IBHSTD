# Overloaded
Everything in release builds that is craft-able should be safe to use. If anything breaks please report it on the Github issue system. There is a lot more coming but they will be behind a default false config setting until I believe they are stable (in crashing and changing of feature sense).

## ModPack Devs - NOTICE
I currently only have vanilla mode recipes and for how powerful most of them items are I would suggest making them a bit more expensive.

## Overview
This mod is designed to be an endgame mod that has very expensive and powerful blocks and items but are server performance friendly.

* Configs for basically every balance value.
* RF Gen in the Billions (Creative by default only, mostly used for testing everything)
* Item/Fluid/RF Storage in the 2^(63-1)  and Infinite Variety (technically 2^(2^32) on Java 8)
* Cross dimensional Storage-Storage transport (for the Overloaded Containers Only)
* Armor: For RF will provide - Full Immunity, Auto Feed, Flight / Run Speed, No Clip, and more 
* Weapons: High Damage Rail Gun and a Lighting Summoner
* Multi-Tool: Breaks blocks instantly at up to 128 blocks away. Can also place at same distance and multiple at a time 

### Future
Lots of plans that are detailed in the Github page. Ex: A large multiblock Fusion Reactor, plan to have hooks into other mods like Botania to add more efficient mana generation and storage.

### Support
All resources are on [Github](https://github.com/CJ-MC-Mods/Overloaded). Please post issues there.
